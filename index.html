    <h1>CIT82SP21 | Assignment | About Page </h1>
  </header>

  <p>The assignment is to develop an <span>“about page”</span> to practice our current HTML and CSS skills. It is easy enough to follow along with the class videos. I quickly discovered it’s a different story when left to my own coding devices. I’m still overthinking my coding process, the VS Code workflow, and how to navigate Github.</p> 
<p>
  I’m not yet skilled enough to code in a state of flow. The flow will come as I become familiar with the code. I am comfortable with the Git workflow of <span>“status, add, commit and push.</span> Navigating the file directory in the git terminal is becoming second nature. <span>Knock on wood!</span>
</p> 
    <p>
      I have learned many nuggets of information from the videos. For example, resetting the font size to 62.5%, setting the margin, padding, box-sizing, and border-box in the CSS file is brilliant. For now, my coding process is video reviews, google searches, and trials and errors—and lots and lots of mistakes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I have two buttons, and I want to learn how to align the elements so that they are equally distributed across the page’s width and centered in height to each other. 
    </p>
  
  <div class="div_button">
  <button>Home</button>
  <button>Next</button>
</div>
